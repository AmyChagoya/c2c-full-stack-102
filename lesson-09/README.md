# Lesson 09

This lesson folder currently contains the **end-state (completed) app for Lesson 08**.

## End State Location

- `/workspaces/c2c-full-stack-102/lesson-09/starter/app`

## How to Run (Codespaces-friendly)

If you want a working copy to run/edit, copy the starter into a working `app/` folder:

```bash
cp -r /workspaces/c2c-full-stack-102/lesson-09/starter/app /workspaces/c2c-full-stack-102/lesson-09/app
```

Then run server and client in 2 terminals:

Server:

```bash
cd /workspaces/c2c-full-stack-102/lesson-09/app/server
npm install
npm start
```

Client:

```bash
cd /workspaces/c2c-full-stack-102/lesson-09/app/client
npm install
npm start
```
